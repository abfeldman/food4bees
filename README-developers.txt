This README is a step-by-step guide on how to set-up a working
development environment for the Food4Bees Index project under Windows
and with Eclipse.

I. PREREQUISITES

   1. Android Development Kit: choose the one that is not bundled with
      an IDE. Run the SDK manager and install the APIs for version 18.
      Also install the Google Play Services version 10.

   2. Eclipse: use the one that can be downloaded from
      http://eclipse.org/
   
   3. Install the Eclipse Android plug-in. To do that, start Eclipse,
      go to "Help/Install New Software...", and add the
      "https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/eclipse/" URL. You need the
      developer tools only (no need to install the NDK).

   4. Install Tomcat from "http://tomcat.apache.org/". You can use the
      windows installer.

   5. Install the Web Tools Platform (the Eclipse plug-in for Tomcat
      development). To do that, start Eclipse, go to
      "Help/Install New Software...", and add the
      "http://download.eclipse.org/webtools/repository/indigo" URL.

   6. Install a recent version of PostgreSQL from
      "http://postgresql.org/download/windows/". You can use the windows
      installer.

   7. Install pgAdmin from "http://pgadmin.org/"
