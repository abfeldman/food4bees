  - Note the /.settings/ directory, if permanently changing project setting, commit this folder
- Database:
  - Download PostgreSQL and set up the PostgreSQL database
  - Create the database using the script in ../db/create-db-food4bees.sql
  - Create the test database using the script in ../db/create-db-food4bees2test.sql
  - Check the /src/main/resources/db_main.properties, change these values, don't commit this file
  - Check the /src/test/resources/db_test.properties, change these values, don't commit this file
- Libraries:
  - Check /lib/README and download the jars from: https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B3nBJAw0aIpCcXBiTnp6Y3pjc1E&usp=sharing
  - Include the jars in the /lib/ directory
- Build and deploy for testing and development:
  - Build and create a .war file through the IDE. Build with Java 1.7 and Java Servlet 3.0.
